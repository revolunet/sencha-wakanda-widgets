Using Sencha widgets in the Wakanda studio
===

You can easily add your own widgets to the Wakanda studio.

If you want to use Sencha Widgets, you first need to import the [revolunet sencha-wakanda adapters](https://github.com/revolunet/sencha-wakanda)

Then, put the widget folder inside your WAF/widgets folder inside your Wakanda studio directory.

We've made a sample datagrid widget, that you can bind to any Wakanda model right from the studio ;)
